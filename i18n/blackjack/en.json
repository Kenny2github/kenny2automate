You will then wait for other players to finish.\n\n*Round End*\n`7.` Once everyone is done, whoever has the highest total value not above 21 wins the round.\n`7a.` If multiple people have the highest score, everyone's cards go into the *pool*, which is collected by the next single winner.\n`7b.` Otherwise, the winner of the round takes all the cards in the pool and all cards in everyone's hands and puts them in their pile.\n`8.` Repeat from `1.`\n\n**End**\nOnce the deck runs out, the game is over and the person whose pile is the largest wins.",
